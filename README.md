# asteroids-clone
A clone of Asteroids developed in Python as part the Coursera.org course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python".

The project was a challenge in keeping track of the location of many objects at a time and calculating when the objects intersected with each other.

The game utilizes a compiler and a GUI package provided by the course creators and can be run by visiting the URL http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_kk1mlNlXsO3jXHV.py and hitting the 'play' button at the top.
